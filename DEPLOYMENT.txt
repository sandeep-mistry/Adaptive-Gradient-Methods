ECS GPU Server Deployment Guide
A set of instructions on how to connect to the ECS GPU server and run our code.

Required Credentials
<username> - UoS username (e.g. sbm1g18) without @soton.ac.uk
<password> - UoS password

1. Connecting
    Must be on the Southampton Eduroam network or using a VPN 
    (https://www.southampton.ac.uk/ageing/postgraduate/taught_courses/dl_welcome/vpn.page)
    In a terminal (or using Putty) ssh to <username>@yann.ecs.soton.ac.uk.
    When prompted, enter <password>
    You should now be connected to the GPU server. 

2. Clone Repo
    Run `git clone https://git.soton.ac.uk/sbm1g18/gradient-methods.git`
    Enter required credentials for gitlab (should be the same as above)
    The repo should now have been cloned.
    
3. Run setup
    Move into the repo folder ('cd gradient-methods').
    Execute './setup.sh
    This will also initialise a Conda environment.

4. Activate Conda environment
    Execute 'conda activate DL'
    This sets the conda working environment to the one just created.

5. Install required packages
    Execute './setup_env.sh'
    This will install all the packages in requirements.txt

6. Running code
    Ensure that the conda environment is active (conda activate DL)
    Execute 'python FILENAME'
